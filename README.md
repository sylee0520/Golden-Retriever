This is the repository of 'Golden Retriever' for AIKU team Project! Golden Retriever is the service that search most similar images given user text query. I think all of you've suffered searching images on your laptop or phone. Golden Retriever can pick up the images fast and correctly like this, Woof!

## Architecture
First, place your own images at folder. And then, (1) generate the caption of images to train the model that can align with images well. In this stage, you'll have image-caption pairs and (2) finetune the text-to-image retrieval model with pairs. Finally, (3) if you put a description of the images you want to search into the trained model, you will get the images you want!
